The hit/miss ratio increased because we have repeatedly accesed the page 394
at the end;
It could possibly happen if:
1) We needed to do the same work at the end of executing of our program in a
cycle. For e.g to check whether the end conditions met or not after some
times after the work is done
2) We can increase this ratio if we introduce the process that repeatedly
access the same page. For e.g the driver for some hardware that checks
the condition of it every cycle.
